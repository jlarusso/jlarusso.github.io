  Who is Jesse La Russo?  Doesn't have the same ring as Keyser SÃ¶ze,
  but that's an unfair comparison.  There's no movie about me. If
  there was, it would start with a heated discussion about current
  events.  The rising action would include my quest for the
  elusive perfect data API.  The climax would be me raising my
  hackathon trophy up above a roaring crowd.  I awaken realizing
  it was all a dream.  The resolution- I grab my laptop and try
  recording all that brilliant code I dreamt up.
