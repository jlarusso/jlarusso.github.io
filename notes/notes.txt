# 7 +/- 2 things you can hold mentally
# Delegation while coding
# Parallels to OOP, coupling
# Process:
  - Recreate
  - Collect info
  - Isolating problem



## Collect info
# ----------------------
# Scrolling output of a file as it changes
$ tail -f log/staging.log

# bisect / blame
# Do this in your ~/.gitconfig file
[alias]
    credit = blame

git log -S "class Product"

Isolate problem
# ----------------------
# pry stuff (put pry in nude glossary)
> ls (what is available in this scope)
> whereami (shows context like at begining of pry session)
> require 'set'; Set.new(1) (this raises an exception)
> wtf; wtf?; wtf?!?!; (stacktrace of most recent exception)
> cat --ex; cat --ex 0; cat --ex 1 (show code at each point in stack trace)
